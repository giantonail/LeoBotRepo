daddy issues
mommy issues
anger management problems
a knack for times tables
dead parents
a loving wife
a lust for vengeance
three daughters
too many toasters
abs
six fingers on your left hand
no chin
a lot of time on your hawnds
a mean streak
a sensitive side
one month left to live
a gambling problem
a galaxy to save
one too many cats
more pudding than you can handle
a really long stick
an eyepatch
a terrible secret
ties to the mafia
seven vaganias
a pickle rick tattoo
two left feet
a seashell collection
an artifact from a long dead civilization
a locket which can't be opened
a lucky rock
more goats than you can count
love in their eyes
a throbbing cock
a craving for toes
nine dogs
a heartwarming smile
a bitchin\' pet dragon
a husband who is a baker and loves them very much
a hatred for Christmas
twice as many candles as is all-together necessary
a wet bussy
